% Naoki Masuda received his PhD in 2002 from the University of Tokyo. He worked as Lecturer and then Associate Professor at the University of Tokyo, Japan, between 2006 and 2014. Then, he worked as Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor at the University of Bristol, UK, between 2014 and 2019. He moved to Department of Mathematics at University at Buffalo in 2019 as Associate Professor and has been full Professor since 2021. His research interests include network science and mathematical biology. In network science, he is particularly known for his work on temporal networks, models of epidemic processes, random walks on networks, and analysis of biological data.

% long biography
%
% Naoki Masuda majored mathematical engineering in the University of Tokyo. He continued his study in the same department and received a master degree in engineering in 2000. His master thesis is on the application of chaotic dynamical systems to cryptosystems. He received a PhD in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 2002. His PhD thesis is on information coding and processing in artificial neuronal networks, where model neurons are coupled to each other by instantaneous pulse-like signals. Then, he did postdoc in Yokohama National University and RIKEN Brain Science Institute, both in Japan, to gradually shift his research topics from computational neuroscience to network science. He was appointed as Lecturer in the Department of Mathematical Informatics, the University of Tokyo in 2006. He promoted to Associate Professor in 2008 and worked there until 2014. Then, he moved to University of Bristol, Department of Engineering Mathematics as Senior Lecturer (equivalent to associate professor) in 2014. His current research interests include network science, evolution of cooperation, various other topics in mathematical biology, and neuroimaging data. In network science, he is probably the most known as expert in temporally varying networks on which he has published a monograph and edited book. In network science, he also works intensively on contagion processes, synchronisation, evolutionary games, core-periphery structure of networks, and various social, engineering and biological data. 
%
% In mathematical biology, his work covers theory of evolution of cooperation, reinforcement learning, animal movement and wisdom of crowds. In neuroimaging data analysis, his focus is on network neuroscience and energy landscape analysis.
%
% In evolutionary game theory, his work covers mechanisms of cooperation under social dilemma situations, such as reputation, social tags and repeated interactions.
%
% He has published over 130 journal papers including PNAS and Nature Communications as the corresponding author and is editorial board member in four internationally recognised journals.
