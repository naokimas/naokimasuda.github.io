<h3>For students and postdocs who may want to join my research group</a></h3>

<p>I moved from SUNY Buffalo to University of Michigan in July 2025. I currently welcome trainees at various levels (specifically, undergraduate, master, PhD, postdoc, or similar).
If you are interested in joining my group, please contact me at my email address shown to the left bar on this webpage or the institutional one (which you can easily find) with your CV. I will answer only if your email is personalized to me.

<p>I belong to <a href="https://medschool.umich.edu/departments/computational-medicine-bioinformatics" target="_blank">Gilbert S. Omenn Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics</a> and <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math" target="_blank">Department of Mathematics</a>. I can advise students from both departments (and probably from other departments as well, but I need to figure it out as new faculty; I started in Michigan in July 2025). 

<p>Math students' (and postdocs') interests do not have to align with biology or medicine. I also do a lot of theoretical things in network science apart from biomedicine (obvious from my publication list). Math students/postdocs who are interested in biology/medicine are of course very welcome, too. Theoretical topics I have been working on nowadays include temporal networks, random walks on networks, nonlinear dynamics on networks, multilayer networks, graphons, community and core detection, and evolutionary games on networks (and this is not an exhaustive list).

<p>On "Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics", which should be broadly construed, currently, I am mainly working on genomics, neuroimaging (particularly, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data), behavioral biology (animal collective decision making), and social networks related to public health, each with domain experts. This looks too diverse, and it is. However, my goal in this research thread is to develop and apply network methods to create knowledge useful for medicine and biology (not just to amuse theoreticians). Anybody interested in any of those or similar topics with backgrounds in, say, mathematics, statistics, physics, computer science, biology, and medicine are welcome.

<p>No matter which of the two lines of research (described above) you are interested in, interests in networks are indispensable because it is what I do. Networks are a fun!

<p>I individually meet each student and postdoc one hour per week, and in person except when either party is traveling.

<p>In addition to that, I have group coffee/lunch about 3 times a month, which anybody can (but do not have to) join. If there are at least two other people who want to join, we would go!

<h3>For prospective postdocs</a></h3>

<p>If I get a research grant to be able to hire a postdoc, I ALWAYS announce it
on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naoki-masuda-57852b72" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naoki.masuda.169" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

<!--
<p>The Department of Mathematics has annual openings for Visiting Assistant Professor (VAP), which is basically postdoc with some teaching. Importantly, the teaching load for our VAPs is substantially lower than VAPs in many other universities in the US. It starts in Fall (i.e., August), and the duration of the appointment is 2 or 3 years, depending on the call. The application deadline is usually November or December, and the job ad (with all details) always appears on <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/" target="_blank">Mathjobs</a> (as well as on the university's job posting webpage). If interested, please apply and alert to me.
