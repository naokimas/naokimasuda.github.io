<h3>For prospective PhD students</a></h3>

<p>I welcome motivated students to carry out PhD research under my advice in the area of network science, mathematial biology, or a closely related field. Read my research <a href="research.html">here</a>.
I can accept PhD students through (1) <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/grad/doctoral-program.html" "target=_blank">Applied Mathematics track of the 
Department of Mathematics PhD program</a> and (2) <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/academics/grad/cdse-phd.html" target="_blank">Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) PhD program</a>.

<p>Entering the PhD program at the Department of Mathematics basically means an applicant successfully gets admitted with a teaching assistantship (TA-ship).
This is a competitive process and common in the US. Even if you want to come to my group and I want to take you, you need to go through this department-wide competitive process. When applying, you do not need to specify a research advisor but you can. I personally prioritize students who really want to come to my group even before coming to our PhD program (because it means you really want to come to my group and such students tend to be stronger). While I won't discuss research topics too much before you get admitted with a TA-ship, please do contact me beforehand if you are interested. The application deadline is usually January.

<p>I do often have research assistantships (RAs), and some of the PhD students advised by me are supported as RA (with no teaching duty and a bit higher salary). However, for multiple reasons, please consider TA-ship as default. I may hire my advisee students as PhD depending on the fit to the funded project, performance, and other factors.

<p>The CDSE PhD program will be good fit for those who do not have a math (or closely related) undergraduate degree. This PhD program basically requires a master degree. If the application is successful, the first two-years of the PhD study will be supported by a TA-ship, and subsequent years will be supported by either TA, RA, or perhaps by a different means. The applicadtion deadline is usually February, but check the <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/academics/grad/cdse-phd.html" target="_blank">website of the program</a>.

<p>One can apply for both PhD programs while you need to pay two application fees.

<p>If you are interested in joining my group as PhD student, please contact me (naokimas@gmail.com) with your CV that includes GPA.
I will answer only if your email is personalized to me (same for postdoc applicants).

<h3>For prospective postdocs</a></h3>

<p>If I get a research grant to be able to hire a postdoc, I ALWAYS announce it
on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naoki-masuda-57852b72" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naoki.masuda.169" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

<p>The Department of Mathematics has annual openings for Visiting Assistant Professor (VAP), which is basically postdoc with some teaching. Importantly, the teaching load for our VAPs is substantially lower than VAPs in many other universities in the US. It starts in Fall (i.e., August), and the duration is 2 or 3 years, depending on the call. The application deadline is usually November or December, and the job ad always appears on <a href="https://www.mathjobs.org/" target="_blank">Mathjobs</a> (as well as on the university's job posting webpage).
