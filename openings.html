<h3>For prospective PhD students</a></h3>

<p>I welcome motivated students to carry out PhD research under my advice in the area of network science, mathematial biology, or a closely related field. Read my research <a href="research.html">here</a>.
I can accept PhD students through (1) <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/grad/doctoral-program.html" "target=_blank">Applied Mathematics track of the 
Department of Mathematics PhD program</a> and (2) <a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/ai-data-science/academics/grad/cdse-phd.html" target="_blank">Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) PhD program</a>.

<p>Entering the PhD program at the Department of Mathematics basically means an applicant successfully gets admitted with a teaching assistantship (TA-ship).
This is a competitive process and common in the US. Even if you want to come to my group and I want to take you, you need to go through this department-wide competitive process. When applying, you do not need to specify a research advisor but you can. I personally prioritize students who really want to come to my group even before coming to our PhD program (because it means you really want to come to my group and such students tend to be stronger). While I won't discuss research topics too much before you get admitted with a TA-ship, please do contact me beforehand if you are interested. The deadline for application is usually January.

<p>The CDSE Program is not tied to Math TA directly. Therefore, a CDSE student needs funding through e.g. a TA-ship in other departments that CDSE Program may offer or research assistantship (RA; when I obtain a research grant; see below) .

<p>Usually, the deadline for application was January for Math and February for CDSE.
<br>One can apply for both.

<h3>For prospective postdocs</a></h3>

<p><strong>If I get a research grant to be able to hire a PhD student or postdoc, I ALWAYS announce it
on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naoki-masuda-57852b72" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naoki.masuda.169" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</strong>
From a student point of view, working as RA on such a grant means that she/he does not have to teach and therefore have more reseaerch time.

<p>If interested, contact me with your CV that includes GPA.
<p>I will answer if and only if your email is personalized to me. If you just change the professor's name in your email template, which you use to contact various professors across the globe, I won't reply.
