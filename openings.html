<h3>PhD and postdoc positions</a></h3>

<p>I welcome motivated students to carry out PhD research under my supervision in the area of network science, mathematial biology, or a closely related field. Read my research <a href="research.html">here</a>.
I can accept students through (1) applied math in 
<a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math.html" "target=_blank">Department of Mathematics</a> and (2)
<a href="https://www.buffalo.edu/icds/programs-and-degrees/cdse.html" target="_blank">Computational and Data Enabled Science and Engineering (CDSE) Program</a>.

<p>(1) Department of Mathematics has been offering about 10 teaching assistantships (TA-ships) each year. A TA-ship implies you do PhD coursework (mostly in the first year) and research while working as TA, which is common in the US. The successful candidate body is diverse. Regarding research, you do not have to specify a supervisor to apply for our Math PhD program. However, if you want to consider me as supervisor from the start, I am happy to discuss.

<p>(2) CDSE Program is not tied to Math TA directly. Therefore, a CDSE student needs funding through e.g. a TA-ship in other departments that CDSE Program may offer or research assistantship (RA; when I obtain a research grant; see below) .

<p>Usually, the deadline for application was January for Math and February for CDSE.
<br>One can apply for both.

<p><strong>If I get a research grant to be able to hire a PhD student or postdoc, I ALWAYS announce it
on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/naoki-masuda-57852b72" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naoki.masuda.169" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.</strong>
From a student point of view, working as RA on such a grant means that she/he does not have to teach and therefore have more reseaerch time.

<p>If interested, contact me with your CV that includes GPA.
<p>I will answer if and only if your email is personalized to me. If you just change the professor's name in your email template, which you use to contact various professors across the globe, I won't reply.
