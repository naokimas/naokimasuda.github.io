<p>Social networks we form and other networks often change over time, and such networks are analysed under the umbrella term temporal networks. Many temporal networks have <q>burstiness</q>. Suppose you meet somebody and have discrete conversation events. Your conversation events would not occur uniformly at random. A chunk of events tends to occur in a burst, which occurs in an intermittent manner (Figure). In technical terms, the inter-event times obey a long-tailed distribution.

    <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3">
    <tr> 
        <td style="text-align:center;"><IMG src="image/event_seq_compare_forweb.png" width="350"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	    <td colspan="2">Fig: A bursty time series. The vertical bar represents the time a conversation event happens e.g. between two particular persons.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

<p>Before burstiness was known, it had been common to assume that conversation events occur as if people arrive at a sales counter sporadically and completely randomly, lacking burstiness (technically, exponential-like distribution of inter-event times). Now we know that this is an oversimplification in many cases.
<p>The Gillespie algorithm, invented in 1970s, is a mathematical/computational technique with which one can numerically simulate systems of <q>interacting event sequences</q> (e.g. a population of humans or molecules) efficiently and without error. In the original form, this algorithm generates non-bursty event sequences. We invented a new variant of the Gillespie algorithm to be able to generate bursty event sequences. We used mathematical tools so-called the <q>Laplace transform</q> and <q>completely monotone functions</q>.
