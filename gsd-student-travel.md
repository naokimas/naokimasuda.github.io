# Travel fund for PhD students in UB Mathematics

Synopsis: Each PhD student can request a fund for one travel up to $1200 and automatically get it as long as the request satisfies the following conditions. Use this!

## Background

- Graduate students should travel! See ``Why you should travel'' section below.
- It is in general not good to expect what you can automatically get. You should actively look for travel money and actively go to conferences with such money. Please see ``Why you should travel'' section below for this, too.

## Rules

- Each PhD student (only PhD) can ask travel money just once for a travel that takes place between the 1st and 5th years in your PhD.
  - So, don't ask me travel money. Here is the answer. I do not support a second travel.
- The max amount is $1200. You cannot split the money into two separate travels. For example, if you want to use $700 this time and want to save $500 for the future, you cannot. If you plan to go to two conferences in one travel, that is fine.
  - Why $1200? I am assuming a domestic conference. However, if you want to travel internationally and it costs more, it is fine for you to cover the deficit. If your travel is domestic but the cost is still above $1200, you need to cover the deficit. $1200 is the maximum we can do.
  - Although I say conference, I do not care whether it is a conference or a smaller workshop.
- You must already have a research advisor.
- Your research advisor must agree with the travel.
- You should present your research in the conference. I know this request ignores different cultures in pure and applied mathematics. If we normalize by the career stage (e.g., 3rd year PhD), pure math sudents probably find it more difficult to already have research to be presented in a conference than applied math students. This is just a cultural difference. Therefore, for applied math students, I require that you present your own research. For pure math students, it is very desirable to do so while I do not impose that. Though I do not impose that for pure math students, the travel should be beyond just attending to the conference you are interested in (e.g., initiating new collaboration, discuss your research with participants, networking for a future visit etc.).
- It's a rolling basis. No deadline.
- We can support up to 10 travels per year. Therefore, if there are more tan 10 people who request the fund, I need to decline and ask you to apply for the next academic year (probably for a different conference because it may be difficult to submit an expense claim for a travel that took place long time ago). However, I think this is unlikely to happen.

## Application and reimbursement procedures

Send Naoki <naokimas@buffalo.edu> the following:

- Conference/workshop's URL
- Estimated cost. A rough estimate is enough. No need to spend too much time. You only follow the UB's travel policy. What can be reimbursed include air fare, other transportation cost, accommodation, conference registration fee, fixed-rate per diem.
  - If the total is over $1200, it is fine. We will pay only up to $1200. 
- Name of your advisor and the confirmation that the advisor has agreed with the proposed travel.
- The title and author list of your presentation.
- Declare all other funding sources, if any, that support the proposed travel. I will only pay the deficit.
- The reimbursement will be done after the travel. You need to submit an expense claim on CONCUR (see UB website to learn how to do that) with budget codes I will tell you.
