<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Earthwatch expedition, Chankillo, Casma Valley,
Peru, 2001</H1>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TH NOWRAP>Location 
<TD> Chankillo: pre-Inca ruins in the desert of Casma Valley.
Casma is 400 km north of Lima, Peru. Casma is a city
with 40,000 along the pacific coast. The main economic activities
are agriculture and tourism owing to archaeological
sites nearby.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Members 
<TD>11 Peruvian (1 leader, 6 archaeologists, 4 manual workers),
7 Americans (3 archaeologists, 4 volunteers) and 1 Japanese.
Other local workers are also hired during daytime.
The leader organized the project, and the results obtained here
will be incorporated into his research.
He is assistant Professor in Peru, and Ph.D. candidate at Yale, USA.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Languages <TD>Spanish and English. Though some people
on Earthwatch say the language is not the primary factor, I think
anybody must be fluent enough in Spanish or English since we have to
communicate, interact, learn, teach, and appreciate.  By the way, many
local people can speak Quechua, which is the language of Inca.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Life 
<TD>We stayed in a hotel ON the beach. The
refreshing wave sound is always there. 4-6
people lived in one bungalow, with private/shared rooms, depending on
the luck. The hotel served dinner.
Every bungalow is equipped with oil lumps, water showers and
easily-broken toilets. Easier to pee in the sea....
Electricity and phone are unavailable, and water supply is very limited.
The neighborhood is quiet since there are no structures nearby.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Work
<TD>6:45 a.m. -- 3:30 p.m. with lunch break for 45 mins.
Excavation at pre-Inca structures.
Stone-made structures such as palaces, plazas and towers remain although
many of them have collapsed. The site is in the desert,
but pretty close to the green area irrigated by a river.
Every day begins from the chilly weather, and the sun
comes up late in the morning to bring us strong sunshines and hotness.
Harsh wind sometimes blows in the afternoon to make up a hard working 
condition; we are working WITH sand.

Our archaeological work goes on repeating the following procedures

<BR>1.measurement, sketch, photos of the site

<BR>2.taking out big rocks which are collapses
from walls or other structures

<BR>3.archaeologists define sites/sub-sites to work in

<BR>4.measurement, sketch, photos of the site (see photo)

<BR>5.dig down to find ground structures such as pillars and hearth.
So called excavation (see photo)

<BR>6.In this stage, a lot of
specimens like canes, woods, bones and shells are found.
They are screened and preserved.

<BR>7.Brush up the site to prepare for photos.

<BR>If the site should be excavated more, go back to 3.

<BR>As a result of repeating procedures 3--7,
the focused area is frequently renewed, and
measurement, sketch and photos are taken very often even though they
are time-consuming. The rational for this is
excavation can never be repeated by its definition.
The volunteers have to take notes about whatever they notice, in order
to record this on-going but never-repeating process.

Of course, newly discovered structures (e.g. pillars, terrace, hearth, walls,
staircases) and specimens provide a lot of information for speculating
on the society and the life of Pre-inca people.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Volunteer
<TD>2-3 volunteers joined one excavation team (called operation)
lead by archaeologists. The archaeologists and
manual workers taught us how to work.
Our work was ..... very hard. Most of the time, 
we devoted ourselves to
picking up rocks, collecting sand, and carrying them out of the
excavation cite, and brushing for photos. 
Though hard, we had a lot of archaeologically important findings 
in two weeks.

The volunteers are also expected to learn something from this project,
provide any skills and ideas, and distribute our experiences
after going back home. Particularly, the last point is important; if
many people get interested in this research, or in Peruvian archaeology
in general, it will help promote archaeology and tourism in Peru,
directly/indirectly improving Peruvian living standards.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Other Activities 
<TD> Visit to Casma city, beach
soccer, parties, swimming in the sea.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Foods <TD> Breakfast was at a trucker restaurant; bread
with delicious fillings such as eggs, potatoes and tuna.  Lunch was
brief with fruits and biscuits which we carried to the site. The hotel
provided monotonous but tasty Peruvian dinner such as corn soup, rice,
chicken, beef, scrambled beans, purple corn juice (Chicha). On weekends,
we went out to Casma for lunch to supply nutrition!?

Fortunately, the volunteers and staffs are friendly. Delicious
Seviche, marinated seafood, was on lunch.  Both Peruvians and Japanese
eat raw fish.  We wasted a lot of time by frequent stops requested by
the police. They are checking transportation of drugs and arms, but in
fact, they are not so serious in it.  The brother of the hotel owner,
who was together with us, talked with every police officer tacitly to
escape from ridiculous inspections. Finally, we finally arrived at the
hotel which literally faces the pacific ocean.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">July 2</FONT> <BR>The first day of work. We started
loading tools at six in the dark. After the short tour to give
volunteers information about the project, we began excavation. Local
workers and archaeologists kindly taught us how. Our work is not just
to dig. We must follow the decision of archaeologists about what to
dig, what to keep intact, where, how deep, or how neatly we should
work. As a team, we must work efficiently, and must avoid destructing
too many. Consequently, archaeological talents include more than field
experiences and knowledge from books. Good archaeologists should be
able to decide properly what area and what subject to work on, assign
appropriate number of coworkers to each site, ask workers/volunteers
to dig/brush how deep/neat, and conduct to everybody the meaning of
current work logically and clearly.  Of course, they must bear
dirtiness and long stay out of home, too. Our leader definitely has
it!

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">July 4</FONT> <BR>The first guy who falls on the
ground is supposed to buy beer for everybody. I joined the bet since I
never fall. Moreover, it is not likely that someone notices me to fall
during the hard work even if I did.  We went to work on the
Independence Day, carrying tools and food.  Hups! Somebody fell on the
sand. Everyone is looking at me. No, it's an illusion!

I am getting used to the work and schedule. 
Everyday passes fast although we work very hard.
They prepared a surprise dinner party for Americans.
We celebrated the Independence day with
decorated flags, beer, special dinner with hamburgers, fireworks and
songs! I pretended to be an American to enjoy the special dinner.
It is amusing that hamburgers which the hotel specially prepared are the worst
dish during the camp. That means Peruvian food is so good.

Disco is one of the main entertainment in Peru.

Excavation continues. We are trying to find walls, floors, and pillars
buried under fillings and collapses of rocks and bunch of sand.
Dig powerfully, and brush carefully. We also make friends with
salamanders and scorpions living under big rocks.
They look cute, but they are very ..... poisonous.
It's so windy that I totally got dirty with sand. According to what
they say, I am an alien
machine armed with eyemask and work gloves. Oh, no!

Of course, I just pretended to be exhausted for a fun!
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">July 12</FONT> <BR>On the last day of work, we
found out a few more pillars and a remain of hearth.  Two weeks have
passed so fast. Now, I don't mind dirty clothes, poor lunch, water
shower etc... Everything is fitting me in two weeks. I have done a lot
of things more than merely archaeology and sightseeing.  I have
experienced wild life styles, have known good people, and have seen a
lot of Peruvian and American manners.

In general, the members of a research project are often regarded as a
minor factor, especially in science projects.  But, it's not the
case here. The leader organizes the project with great insight and
prospect. At the same time, he wants to share experiences not only
with other professionals but also with many others.  And then, good
archaeologists sympathize and cooperate him. A good team is
constructed this way, the volunteers bringing in fresh flavor and
different points of view.  In relaxed moods, everyone is highly
motivated to work for his/her own role, to result in high research
performance as a whole. Science researchers like me should learn a lot
from here.

Peru is the country which had president Fujimori. Though he is under
criticism now, Peruvians as well as Americans have strong interests in
Japan. Of course, they have only limited opportunities to meet Japanese.
What I missed during the camp (during the whole travel also)
is that I could not explain Japanese culture very well, not only
because of my sucking English/Spanish skill, but because of the lack
of knowledge about Japan. In particular, politics, religion, history and
traditional culture such as tea ceremony or Haiku were beyond my scope.
However, I can be proud of Japanese cultures, and
they characterize Japan which underlie my background. By
next time, I will get ready for telling them Japan, to exchange and to know
Japan and myself.
