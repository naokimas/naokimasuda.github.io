<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Future Centre Trust, Barbados</H1>

What's FCT?

<P>Q: For what?
<BR>A: To assist Barbadians in living in harmony with nature.

<P>Q: Strategy?
<BR>A:<OL>
<LI>To inform, by creating the Barbados Future Centre Trust
where people can encounter working models of a
sustainable future -- from all over the world, as well as from
Barbados.
<LI>
To transform, by applying the information they have 
to actual movements, influencing
on lifestyles, economics and society.
</OL>

<P>Q: What is sustainability?
<BR>A: Use resources without imposing debts to the future generations.
Take care of our country so that our descendants can have
healthy and productive environments. Not exploit our natural
capital, but restrain a bit of our desire. Think ahead.
Common sense.

<P>Q: What will it include?
<BR>A: Agriculture, communications, eco-nomics, climate change, water, health
, biological and cultural diversity, education, energy, industry, oceans
and coasts, transport, laws, tourism, waste management, ethical/scientific/spi
ritual issues.
<BR>Of special importance will be Job Creation which has
two successful examples in Europe,
an Eco Farm/Garden, and a display of photovoltaic technology
by our power company.

Documentation Centre and restaurant. When we turn right after enterance,
two lace entrances suddenly appear.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctin2.jpg" WIDTH="45%" HEIGHT="60%" ALIGN="left">
If we enter the left (Horrors), we can see
the present way of life and its consequence when no treatment is done
in the future.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctin3.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right">
Too bad. What are the role models
in which the current aptitudes are checked or even
reversed? We can see it in the right room (Hopes).
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctin4.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left">
"Conference room" with cuty dolls. Each doll play a role of representative
of each interest. They are discussing, say,
environmental problems.
They can stir up 
the interest of non-awared visitors or children
who are responsible for future. 
It's necessary to take in various hierarchies of people.

<P>All around the wall is
a cree Indian prophercy:
only after the last tree has been cut down, only after the last river has been poisoned, only after last fish has been caught, only then will you find that money cannot be eaten.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctin5.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right">
They argue not only environmental or natural problems but also
others like
AIDS, crimes, child abuse and poverty.

Message is conveyed with fun and intrigue,
enhanced by art, sculpture and music. <BR CLEAR="all">

A sculpture created by local artists. Others are under construction outside.
They work as volunteers.<BR CLEAR="all">

Footprints in the photo indicates "ecological foot print" of Barbados.
Ecological foot print is
the area needed to support an entity,
suppling the needs and absorbing the emissions.

The ecological foot print of Barbados is nine times their size.
This is mainly because of a lot of the fossil fuel used by the visitors
and Jumbo Jet. 

According to this evaluation, the ecological foot print of Japan is smaller
than other developed countries. Really? Shouldn't be bigger?
<BR CLEAR="all"> 

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctin9.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right">
The photos and boards to demonstrate their events and tours.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout1.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left">
Compost toilet. Composting is a natural recycling process in which
human waste and toilet paper are broken down by microbes into their
constituent minerals and cotverted back to earth.  Heat, oxygen,
organic material and moisture are needed to transform the waste into
fertilising soil. One toilet costs $1100 - 1500 US. <BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout2.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right"> 
Solar Panels (Photovoltaics). Here the power is used
to run a small fountain in a pond.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout3.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left"> 
The trees called  "Nacadero" screen the house, give shades,
increase privacy and make the area more attractive.
Japanese houseworks should learn such an idea.<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout4.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right"> 
Grey water system. The white barrel receives
all the kitchen water and filters it roughly through coral chips.
The effluent is sprayed into the compost heeps and fruit trees.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout5.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left">
The plant in the middle is 
NEEM: a remarkable Indian tree for medical, insecticidal, nematicidal
and decorative uses. Also for cleaning teeth.

<P>By the way, FCT is trying permaculture.
Permaculture integrates the dwellings, work-places, gardens and grounds
into a single entity. Every part helps each other.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<UL>
<LI>
Use of roof water. The stored water is used for irrigation.
<LI>Mulching: covering the surface of farm with leaves.
 It prevents erosion, retains moisture in
the soil, suppresses weed growth and reduces the soil temperature
to encourage root growth.
Their most important mulch is Lemon Grass.
<LI>Tyre gardening. Tyre gardens require less water, reduce
the need for weeding, save stooping, and help the diversity of cropping
which is important in natural pest control.
</UL>

Weed control is the primary problem of tropical agriculture.
They are getting over it by focusing on perennial and tree crops
grown in tyres and massive amount of mulch.

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout6.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right">
An african tree is grown up inside the tyre in the middle.
Yellow circles around it mean the expected diameters after 50 years,
100 years and 150 years, respectivfely.
The circles were drawn 
to succeed the history of this tree, FCT and Barbadian nature to
future generations. Exhibition of FCT is full of such wits.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout11.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left">
A heap of compost. Young fruits are planted
around the heap although invisible in the photo.
An small forest develops around each heep, and young plants of
one theme characterize one forest. For instance, <BR CLEAR="all">

<UL>
<LI>Large trees but less appreciated by the early settlers,
common and easy to grow.
<LI>Tough places.
<LI>Salt tolerant.
<LI>Trees for the grandchildren.
<LI>Windbreak trees.
<LI>Medical properties.
<LI>For making things.
<LI>Medium-sized trees, easy to grow.
<LI>Important large timber trees, very few of these trees remain.
</UL>

By the way, there are four mahogany trees nearby. Between them
will be a rope walkway sponsored by the Barbados Defense Force.

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout7.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right">
The Barbados cherry tree of acerola. A lot of them are in the neighborhood.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout8.jpg" WIDTH="65%"HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left">
We can find many of such notices.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout9.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="right">
<P>Hane-made Chapel. Silk Cotton,
a sacred tree in Africa, is in the middle.
I think FCT has no religious color, but around Chapel
are put up many notices like the one in the last photo,
invoking coexistence of humans and nature.
Coming under the shade here, escaping from the sunshine,
I turned very serene, feeling mother nature.
<BR CLEAR="all">

<P><IMG SRC="activity/fctout10.jpg" WIDTH="65%" HEIGHT="40%" ALIGN="left">
<P>In the left back in the photo,
Nacadero trees are planted along the border of the farm. Nacadero
is a south American tree with very high level of
edible protein in the leaves. For example,
Nacadero leaves are used to feed animals.

<P>In the yellow part in the back is Short Rotation Coppice.
When fossil fuels become short, we will probably have to
grow our fuel (biomass) as the people had done for hundreds of years.
SRC (Short Rotation Coppicing):
Like sugarcane, when some trees are cut down, they produce 
many new shoots from the stump. These grow rapidly on the old
root system and produce new trunks.

<P>Green strong one in the front is sugar cane. It's taller than humans.
<P>The plants produced in
tyre gardens are provided to their delicious restaurant.

A TAMARIND tree. This hill is a "theater".
TAMARIND is useful for

<LI>pulp
<LI>Tamarind rod administering disciplimary measures to youngsters
<LI>brown pulp as seasoning in curries, sause, fruit drink, fruit yogurts
<LI>seeds can be eaten roasted
<LI>over ripe fruit are used as copper and brass polishes
<LI>young leaves and flowers in salads

A Rabbit. Chickens, pigs and geese are also kept.
By the way, in the net next to it, grapefruit is planted.
Grapefruit is originated from Barbados. Did you know it?
