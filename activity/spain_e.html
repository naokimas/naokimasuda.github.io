<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Workcamp Marismas de Santon~a, Spain, 2000</H1>

<TABLE BORDER>
<TR>
<TH NOWRAP>Location 
<TD> Marsh area in Laredo & Santo~na, which
are small cities in Cantabria district along the north coast of
Spain. These areas are designated as a protection area. They are marsh
when the tide is low, and turn into isolated islands separated by sea
water when high tide. 

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Members 
<TD>15 Spanish, 4
French, 3 Japanese, and 2 German. Four Spanish who belong to a local
NGO (SGO) led the camp.  SGO is engaged in the protection of the local
nature 

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Languages 
<TD>Spanish and English 

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Life 
<TD>We stayed in a municipal youth hostel. Maximum
8 people lived in one bungalow. Showers, toilets, and meals were
prepared by the hostel.  We could play various kinds of sports such as
basketball, volleyball, football, table tennis, table soccer, canoe,
cycling, rock climing, athletics and swimming in the pool.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Work
<TD>Many kinds of work regarding the protection of
nature in the marsh area; for example, marsh work including weaving,
garbage collection in the river, making and installing bird traps,
building huge poles for the birds to rest on, quesionaries,
birdwatching, bird counting.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Other Activities <TD>Excursion, dying shirts, making
and playing music instruments, meditation, Yoga, dancing, rock
climing, athletics, playing mini theater, cycling, football,
volleyball, water polo, MANY fiestas (parties) including Hippy party,
Lerele championship (see below) etc.

<TR><TH NOWRAP>Meals <TD>Though every meal was provided by the
accomodation, it was very poor. This is the only disappointment during
the workcamp. From the second day, we could guess precisely what they
served based on the menus of previous days! Basically, no vegetable was
served. Is that mean everybody gained weight after the camp!?

The purpose of our work was to protect and recover the nature so that
it became suitable
for traveling birds. The project content was introduced
very clearly using slides.
SGO hosted the camp
with perfect planning and organization.

At night, we had a humorous and witty introduction party.
Everyone introduced oneself applying his/her shade projected on
a big cloth by a light.
Spanish can hit upon a play only with one piece of cloth!
At any moment,
they elegantly betrayed a Japanese common notion that we cannot play
without money.

We climbed a mountain, and then came to a cliff.
An old firehouse and the darkblue sea were found 
200 meters down (see photo). A bunch of us
didn't hesitate to stepping down more than 500 stairs, and swam.
Why are you so powerful after mountain climing!?
At any moment, they powerfully 
betrayed a Japanese common notion that we take a rest after work. Moreover,
the temprature of water was just 17 degree celcius. Since it was too
cold for me to swim,
I was going to take a rest sitting on a rock. Of course, it
didn't make sense. They called me,
"Naokiiiii, Naokiiiii", from the deep and stormy sea.

Yes, they had already remembered my name on the second day, because I
had slipped so often because of my shoes.
Anyway, I swam. We enjoyed supreme scenery through a sea cave below the cliff.

We worked in the marsh, and did campfire.

People say Spanish are just cheerful, but they can modulate their
modes. They work hard when they should, and play hard when they can.
Smile and cheerfulness are indispensable spices in life. Although
conversation skill in Spanish could help enjoy the camp more,
entertainments such as campfire, dancing and games are universally
shared without languages.

Cycling. Taking a break at natural water source (see
photo). We found beautiful stone buildings, greens, birds. Really refreshing!
<BR CLEAR="all">

We went out to una fiesta (a festival) at night.
Many local people got together and danced: the olds, children, women,
men, everyone. Many tents were built around the festival. We drank, danced,
sang, and went to sleep whenever we wanted, without worrying about
driving back.

Hard manual work. We weaved Bursaras (What is a bursara?  I can show
you how to make one). In the evening, we completed in Lerele
championship.

¡©Qu/e es Lerele? (What is Lerele?)

No one answered. But, play courts were established on table tennis
tables. They asked each of us to
prepare three coins. This is 10-yen
football (a 10-yen is a Japanese coin). I practiced it in the junior
high. I manipulated coins with both hands, and finally won the championship.

Garbage collection in the marsh using canoes. Though beautiful,
the marshes were full of
deserted plastics and cans. In the end, we found a
refrigerator sunk in the water. Many local people are ignorant of
environmental affairs though many others care.

Dressed up for Hippy party.

At night, we shared a great party
without languages, but with
drum, music, games, dance and sports. 
Spanish values cannot be measured with simple gauges like money
or achievement while they are important to some extent.
They value their true colors, interaction, and happy lives.

We digged a huge hole in a vast land, and built up a huge pole for birds.
Extremely fatigue. In the afternoon, we went out for
a flower festival in the town of Laredo. More than 20 flower-made carriages
paraded, each of which carried decorated girls.

We drove bicycle, and interviewed workers in the marsh area
(see photo) collecting shellfish. License is required
to work in the protected area. Though they are exploiting natural resources,
they have their own dreams and lives.
In the afternoon, we played hand-made musical instruments with
dancing, did rock climing and athletics, and 
enjoyed mini theater. We were active
with infinite stamina. Spanish are genius in playing. Dancing and
humor are indispensable to live in Spain.

Work in a huge marsh area to set up a huge pole for birds.
Our procession of bicycles strayed into a blind alley ending up with a bush.
There were two choices, facing 50 meters left before getting
to the spot.
<BR>A: carry bicycles through a train tunnel. Trains come once
in two hours.
<BR>B: dash through the bush by bicycle, this should be
called a brute force method. 
<BR>We didn't have the following option:
<BR>C: go back to find the right way.
We chose B. We rashed into bush with no trail (see photo).
Many people made scratches.

In the marsh work, many people fell on mad, and everybody was covered
with mud after fighting against each other on the marsh. The greatest work!

Last weaving. In the afternoon, we separated into
three groups and matched with the last and most intense games. 
For example, our tasks were

<UL>
<LI>Pick up shit of cows.
<LI>All the team members pour their shits in a bottle, to
explore the maximal total volume.
<LI>Three make a three-floored tower in the pool.
<LI>Take off as many clothes as possible, and align them on a
line to realize the maximum length.
</UL>

I can't explain more.....

Finally, we drank in the deep forest to enjoy the last night.

At first, I suspected that a large group leads to superficial
relationship. Actually, it was true that 
we had limited opportunities to talk with each other, and
my Spanish skill was very limited. However, 
I felt Spanish spirits and their personalities
in daily conversations, crazy games,
dancing, parties and so on.
They were ardent
in playing, enjoying, working, and living. It was a great
workcamp which motivated me to come to Spain again and to study
Spanish more to communicate with them.
