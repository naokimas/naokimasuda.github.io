from the Marburg downtown. The last bus is at 8:00 p.m., and 
Marburg is 100km north of Frankfurt, and is a 
university town with 80,000.
Marburg is famous for Grim brothers, who wrote fairy tales.
The town has many slopes preventing easy walking.

trampoline... my body sank into the trampoline.

<P>We, Japanese team, cooked Japanese food. Nikujaga, miso-soup,
fried fish etc. Nikujaga was popular to them.
Russians couldn't drink miso-soup.
We went to disco at night. It was actually my
debut to disco. One hour walk from the camp.
In Germany, disco is a normal passtime, like Karaoke in Japan.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mar 21 (Sat)</FONT>
<P>Visit to K o &#246; ln. The big church and Chocolate Museum were great.
The exhibition at Chocolate Museum includes
the history of chocolate, how to make,
what kinds there are, and regional distribution.
we could even try sample chocolate. Cute!
We, eleven people, stayed at the house of a leader.
Although it's so large for one person
and K o &#246; ln is a big modern city,
the house rent is only 30,000yen/month.
Disco drove us totally crazy.
This weekend trip was defined to be an 'official' event,
so PRO paid everything including train fee, food and disco.

Snowfall, late in March

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mar 23 (Mon)</FONT>
<P>Awfully cold. Because my bed (=trampoline)
is at the windowside?? I opened the window to find ... SNOW!
Thanks to snow, we were free from leaves that day, and 
instead, we worked inside. In the afternoon,
I ran to the station (7 kilometers) to enjoy freetime.
Some of us visited a pub with
live music show. Chique.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Mar 24 (Tue)</FONT>
<P>The German leaders and the Almenian member had a quarrel.
The almenian compained about the monotonous work and 
strong authority of the leaders;
difficult dispute. However, the worst accident happened in the night.
I got up in the night.
「(bathroom...)」.GAMM!!!!
「Uuu,Uuu」I hit the thumb of left foot against the bed.
blood! blood!
The wound cursed me during my travel after the workcamp.
