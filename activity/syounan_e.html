<TR><TH NOWRAP>Life
<TD>We slept in sleeping bag on the floor at Kataoka kindergarden.
Everything were tiny... chairs, toilets, sinks. It's amusing to 
return to kindergarden after a long interval.
The president of kindergarden kindly let us use
kitchen, pianos, beach ball and play instruments.
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Work
<TD>According to others, 
they helped the summer festival of kindergarden

and had some discussions on organic agriculture.
The work finished before four, and we enjoyed long free time.
<TR><TH NOWRAP>Foods
<TD>We took turns to prepare breakfast and supper.
Ohira family, owner of farm, served us huge lunch to yield
leftover for suppers and breakfasts.

I arrived there late in the evening. I was exhausted 
after walking 3km from the station.
It seemed there's no entrance to kindergarden. Uryaaa!!
I jumped over the main gate by berry-roll style with Karate spirit, to
join the camp finally. We went to Sentou (public bath).
Every day, we had nice exercise to Sentou which is
15 minutes by bicycle.

In the morning (9:00 -- 12:00), we weeded carrot and tomato field,
and took a green house apart.
It was so hot that the leader shifted the working hour 1hr
earlier from the following day.
We discussed organic agriculture in the afternoon.
The Czeck and German members stated the situation of organic
agriculture in their countries.
In Czeck, neither producers nor consumers are conscious of it, and
the distribution system is weak now. In Germany, 
organized distribution system and certification system are arranged.

We kept on working with green house in the morning.
In the afternoon, we discussed organic agriculture in Japan and Korea.
Uum, Japanese members prepared poorly. Summer festival of 
TORAY, an industrial company, in the evening (see photo).
We took part in Bon-dance (Japanese traditional dance).
Good experience for foreign members. You guys have to spread this dance
in your countries!

Free day. 4 visited Tokyo,
and 6 went to Yokohama.
Our Yokohama group saw the port of Sakuragi-cho, ate in China town,
visited Sankeien, a Japanese garden, in Honmoku.
When we were eating dinner in Ofuna,
we encountered a very, very, very heavy rainfall.
Yes, a big and slow typhoon was coming.

No outdoor work because of typhoon.
In the afternoon, we visited a local rice field, and
took afternoon tea at Mos Burger, a hamburger shop, which uses
organic vegetables. A German member said Mac is more delicious...
I don't agree with her!

Last work!
Field work all the day. In the afternoon, we
weeded a green house, eggplant field and green pepper field.
Everyone but me was bitten by many mosquitos.
No mosquitos came to me because I am a good person.
More weekend participants arrived in the evening, and we went out
for Karaoke.

We cleaned the kindergarden. Thank you very much...
In the afternoon, We had farewell barbecue
party with local people under the record-breaking
rainfall. 
I was bare-footed. We enjoyed bowling in the evening.
One guy who is hated by mosquitos 
fell during his approach running. Another
dropped her ball during her approach. 
We stayed up late and talked a lot to enjoy the last night.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1">Aug 31 (Mon)</FONT>
We went out for lunch with the presidents of kindergarden, and we said
good-bye. I brought back some vegetables as souvenir.
The only food on my dish was pumpkin for sucessive four days.
Yes, I love it, and finally I became a pumpkin man.
