# New Graduate Student Orientation (Naoki's part) &ndash; Fall 2024

I have only 15 mins, so only key things you should know right now. I will present all others in my talk in Graduate Mentoring Seminar next week.

## TA/grader duties

This is for PhD students only.

- The TA training was on August xxth and xxth. So the new TAs already know about general duties.
- Grader training during Week xx.
- Handled by Dr. Tara Hudson (?). Contact her for any questions.

## Graduate Mentoring Seminars, Tuesdays 5-6pm @ Math 250

- This is 0-credit seminars, but this is mandatory for all the first-yera graduate students.
- Semester topics will cover a range of skills that professional mathematicians will need to master. Also, professors in the department - The schedule will be circulated soon.
  - First talk by me next week on the structure of the graduate programs.
  - No seminars in some weeks (you will see it in the schedule that will be distributed).

- Familiarity with LaTeX?

## You must
- come to classes
- promise deadlines for homework
- respond to instructor/staff's emails when necessary
- Why should you do these?
  - Such basics will be needed when you start to really work in academia or industry. Nobody wants people who cannot do those basics.
  - Who can be your advisor in the future? Who can write recommendation letters in the future?


## First-year courses

- They are already starting!
- PhD and MA: You need to choose Pure or Applied Track and take the corresponding mandatory courses.
- MS: Read carefully the requirement and plan it ahead.
- MA and MS: Show me your choices by email.
- More on this next week.

## Other presentations in the orientation event

- Lisa Gagnon came to talk about scholarship/fellowship. Their main webpage is [here](https://www.buffalo.edu/grad/explore/funding/fellowships.html). I share their slides by email.
- [Not this year] Graduate Student Employees Union (GSEU) representatives talked about [GSEU](https://www.buffalo.edu/administrative-services/for-faculty-staff/benefits/state/gseu.html).
- Librarian Keith Nichols talked about [UB library](https://library.buffalo.edu/).
- Marla McBride came to talk about wellness. Their main webpage is [here](https://www.buffalo.edu/studentlife/life-on-campus/health.html).

# Structure of graduate programs &ndash; presented in a Graduate Mentoring Seminar (by Naoki) 

##	First-year courses for PhD and MA students

Read your program's webpage under the "Graduate" tab on [the department's website](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math.html).

The first year courses are structured as a cohort sequence. You must be enrolled in either Pure or Applied track.

### Fall semester offering:

#### Pure track
-	Analysis--measure theory (MTH 534)
-	Algebra--groups and rings (MTH 519)
-	Geometry/Topology--point set topology (MTH 527)

####	Applied track
-	Numerical analysis I (MTH 537)
-	Methods of applied mathematics I (MTH 539)
-	Either of the three mandatory courses in the Pure track

### Spring semester offering:

#### Pure track
-	Analysis--complex analysis (MTH 625)
-	Algebra--module and galois theory (MTH 520)
-	Geometry/Topology--homotopy theory (MTH 528)

####	Applied track
-	Numerical analysis II (MTH 538)
-	Methods of applied mathematics II (MTH 540)
-	Either of the three mandatory courses in the Pure track or Applied Complex Analysis (new)
    -	Details of Applied Complex Analysis will follow. Stay tuned.

- If you are MA student or unsupported PhD student, you must register for a fourth course.
- There is an evaluation exam (often called qualifying exam) associated with each of the above courses. Evaluation exams are given during finals week. How it is given depends on the course, and the course instructor will let you know.
  - Many instructors of those courses use the final exam as the evaluation exam.
- PhD students must pass 4 out of 6 evaluation exams. MA students must pass 3 out of 6.
- Taking graduate classes as a cohort is meant to encourage studying mathematics in groups. So, create and get into study groups! (Also recommended for MS students)

##	First-year courses for MS students

- There is nothing named first-year courses.
- Plan NOW how many semesters you want to spend to graduate and which mandatory/elective courses you plan to take.
- Some courses do not occur every year/semester.
  - If you go to [the courses website](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/courses.html), you can see all the Fall and Spring courses.
  - Popular courses fill quickly. Act quickly once the registration is open.
- A research project (3 credits) is mandatory in the third semester (if you plan to graduate in three semesters). You should contact preferred professor as advisor sometime between the second and third semester, or during the second semester.

## Second and later years of the PhD course &ndash; Not many people have told this to you

### Credit count

- 72 credits to graduate, but this won't usually be an issue.
- You need to take an oral examination to advance to candidacy (Let's call it "oral exam").
  - Before you pass "oral exam", you need to take 9 credits per semester if you are TA and 12 credits per semester if you are not TA.
  - After you pass "oral exam", you only need to take 1 credit per semester.

### Start research

- At any point, you can look for research advisor (a.k.a. thesis advisor, or supervisor. Let's simply call it "advisor").
    - You approach preferred professor anytime to ask.
    - Some professors may say yes, some may say no, for various reasons.
    - Some professors prefer to start from the Reading course rather than to immediately agree with your advisor.
    - Only tenure-line professors (excluding Clinical Professors, who focus on teaching, or Visiting Assistant Professors, whose terms are 2-3 years only)
- Can take the Research course or Reading course for a variable number of credits.
    - An approval by the advisor (or the professor who has agreed to do a Reading course with you) is needed.
    - Paperwork is needed for registering to the Research/Reading course. Ask Jenny Russell.
- You may be hired as RA (research assistant) instead of TA.
    - It depends on the professor. Don't ask me.
    - You can come back to TA if the RA period has finished. The department monitors all such information, so no worries.
- MA: Research is not mandatory. However, if you want to, contact professors who you want to have as advisor to see if they are willing to advise you.
    - Research or Reading course credits are available upon the consent of the advisor (and my approval).
- MS: See above. You must do research in the third (or final) semester.

## [Mentor](#mentor)

- Ignore what HUB says on this. They automatically fill the advisor/mentor's names (?) but are not relevant.
- I assign each new PhD student a mentor unless you already have an advisor.
- Mentor and advisors are different by definition. Let's distinguish between these two terms!
- Mentor's roles:
  - Advise the mentee on the course choice.
  - Help the mentee to find research advisor.
  - Possibly pass to the mentee information on relevant seminar talks, gatherings, etc.
  - Not required to meet the mentee on a regular basis. It is up to the mentor. However, I ask the mentor to meet the mentee at least twice a semester. The mentor may wonder what they should discuss with their mentees. Here are some ideas:
      - How they are doing with the ongoing courses?
      - Their academic interests?
      - Where they are from? How were their previous institutions and programs?
      - How they spend time in Buffalo (apart from studying)?
      - What do they want to become? (though it may be too early for them to have clear plans).
      - You may be willing to share your own academic interst, your experiences, or any stories with your mentee.
      - Conferences or seminars you are going to, courses you are teaching, etc.
      - Connect them to other graduate students or postdocs in the research field, if it is beneficial for them.
- The selection of the mentor is based on the research area you expressed in your graduate school application (recommendation by each area committee's chair), but, importantly, it does not mean that you need to follow that path. If one wants to switch from algebra to topology, for example, it is totally fine. 
- Likewise, importantly, the mentor and advisor are totally independent things. Mentor does not imply advisor.
- MA and MS: You don't have personal mentor. Jenny Russell and I are your contacts.

## TA work

Since learning to teach mathematics is an integral part of your doctoral training, it is the policy of the dept. that all Ph.D. students be given a TAship as soon as possible.

- Exception: RA. But, as far as I know, we have not had prior examples of 5-year RAs.
-	You will receive your TA assignments the week before classes begin, and you should contact the instructors immediately upon receiving your assignments. Recitations start in the first week of classes.
  -	Contact Associate Chair (not me) for teaching duties.
  -	Tara Hudson and others lead TA training.

## Travel

- Basically, everything should be done on [CONCUR](https://www.buffalo.edu/administrative-services/business-travel/travel-expense-reimbursement-system.html), a UB's online system. Help on CONCUR is available at
    - online documentation and video tutorials on the CONCUR page cited above.
    - [Reimbursement and Procurement (RP) team](https://arts-sciences.buffalo.edu/faculty-staff/faculty-staff-resources/shared-services/reimbursement-procurement.html). At the bottom of the page, there is an icon "Online Request Portal" for students to submit their request. The students will need to provide the department account number on where the reimbursement is coming from. 
- Currently, you need to submit a pre-travel approval on CONCUR before you travel.
    - This is required even if your travel is paid by, e.g., a different university.

## SPEAK test

All international PhD students have to pass a SPEAK test (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) to be able to teach. If you are RA (research assistantship, i.e., supported by a professor's reesarch grant money), you may finish PhD without teaching at all, but the UB policy dictates that you nevertheless have to pass the SPEAK test. Details are [here](https://www.buffalo.edu/english-language-institute/graduate/speak-test.html#title_122627731). Note that this webpage contains a practice test as well.

So, international PhD students should do the following right away:

- Book a SPEAK test with them. How to book it? See the instructions on their webpage (URL given above).
  - **Unless you register the SPEAK test in August (regardless of whether youp ass the test or not), you cannot register courses.**
- If you are from an English speaking country, contact them (their contact address should be available on their website) if you are exempt or not.
- If you pass it, you are done!
- If you don't, you need to retake it. The department will provide training for you to pass the exam within two years.
