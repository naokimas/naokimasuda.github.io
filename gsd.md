- Hello
- How are you?

New Graduate Student Orientation (Naoki's part) --- Fall 2022 

#	First-year courses

The first year courses are structured as a cohort sequence. You should be enrolled in either Applied or Pure track.

## Fall semester offering:

### Pure track
-	Analysis--measure theory (MTH 534).
-	Algebra--groups and rings (MTH 519).
-	Geometry/Topology--point set topology (MTH 527).

###	Applied track
-	Analysis--measure theory (MTH 534).
-	Methods of applied mathematics I (MTH 539).
-	Numerical analysis I (MTH 537).

## Spring semester offering:

## Pure track
-	Analysis--complex analysis (MTH 625).
-	Algebra--module and galois theory (MTH 520).
-	Geometry/Topology--homotopy theory (MTH 528).

###	Applied track
-	Analysis--complex analysis (MTH 625).
-	Methods of applied mathematics II (MTH 540).
-	Numerical analysis II (MTH 538). 

If you are in the M.A. program or you are an unsupported Ph.D. student, you must register for a fourth course.

There is an evaluation exam associated with each of the above courses. Evaluation exams are given during finals week. How it is given depends on the course, and the course instructor will let you know.

Students in the Ph.D. program must pass 4 out of 6 evaluation exams. M.A. students must pass 3 out of 6.

Taking graduate classes as a cohort is meant to encourage studying mathematics in groups. So, create and get into study groups!

#	Tuesday Mentoring seminars, 5-6 pm, room 250.

During the fall, semester topics in this seminar will cover a range of skills that professional mathematicians will need to master.  For the spring semester, professors in the department will give introductory talks on their area of research.  This seminar is mandatory for all first year graduate students, so please make this time slot available….someone has to eat the pizza.

______________________________________________________




Since learning to teach mathematics is an integral part of your doctoral training, it is the policy of the dept. that all Ph.D. students be given a TAship as soon as possible.

Training session with Prof.’s Rosas & Javor, Friday, August 23rd, starting at 9:30 a.m. in Room 150.

•	Resources:  Prof.’s Ringland, Rosas, Javor, and DGS.
•	You will receive your TA assignments the week before classes begin, and you should contact the instructors immediately upon receiving your assignments.  Recitations start in the first week of classes.
•	Only 12 hours per week.  If more see DGS (me) or the Assoc. Chair, Prof. Ringland

#	Other funding sources: (DGS)
•	Summer school teaching.
•	Research fellowships.



#	Mathematical life. (DGS)
-	Department colloquium, usually on Thursdays.
-	Regular weekly seminars: Algebra, Analysis, Applied, and Geometry/Topology.
-	Myhill lectures, usually in Spring.
-	Regional graduate workshops.  (More will be covered in Tuesday Mentoring seminar.)
-	Funding.-GSA, DGS.
-	Look at the AMS publication “A mathematician’s survival guide”.


#	Miscellaneous
-	International students - change of address, I-20, Speak test
-	Jury duty
-	Office and mailbox keys can be obtained from main office.
-	Health insurance orientation
-	Your UB student ID card is your swipe card into the building.
-	Graduate copier, room 236. 


#	Don’t forget the Welcoming Party:  eat pizza and wings, and have your picture taken for the Department’s Bulletin Board.
