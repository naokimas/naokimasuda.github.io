# New Graduate Student Orientation (Naoki's part) --- Fall 2022 

##	First-year courses

The first year courses are structured as a cohort sequence. You should be enrolled in either Applied or Pure track.

### Fall semester offering:

#### Pure track
-	Analysis--measure theory (MTH 534)
-	Algebra--groups and rings (MTH 519)
-	Geometry/Topology--point set topology (MTH 527)

####	Applied track
-	Analysis--measure theory (MTH 534)
-	Methods of applied mathematics I (MTH 539)
-	Numerical analysis I (MTH 537)

### Spring semester offering:

#### Pure track
-	Analysis--complex analysis (MTH 625)
-	Algebra--module and galois theory (MTH 520)
-	Geometry/Topology--homotopy theory (MTH 528)

####	Applied track
-	Analysis--complex analysis (MTH 625)
-	Methods of applied mathematics II (MTH 540)
-	Numerical analysis II (MTH 538)


- If you are in the M.A. program or you are an unsupported Ph.D. student, you must register for a fourth course.
- There is an evaluation exam associated with each of the above courses. Evaluation exams are given during finals week. How it is given depends on the course, and the course instructor will let you know.
- Students in the Ph.D. program must pass 4 out of 6 evaluation exams. M.A. students must pass 3 out of 6.
- Taking graduate classes as a cohort is meant to encourage studying mathematics in groups. So, create and get into study groups!

## Mentor

- Each new PhD student is assigned a mentor unless you already have a research advisor.
- Mentor's roles:
  - Advise the mentee on the course choice.
  - Help the mentee to find research advisor.
  - Possibly pass to the mentee information on relevant seminar talks etc.
  - Not required to meet the mentee on a regular basis. It is up to the mentor.
  - The mentor system is only two years old. So, for now, let the mentor serve only the first year. Then, I will have a town meeting or similar to ask students whether the mentor has been useful. If yes and they want to continue to have the mentor, then I will ask the mentor to continue serving till they find research advisor.
- The selection of the mentor is based on the research area you expressed in your graduate school application (recommendation by each area committee's chair), but, importantly, it does not mean that you need to follow that path. If one wants to switch from algebra to topology, for example, it is totally fine. 
- Likewise, importantly, **the mentor and research advisor are totally independent things. Mentor does not imply research advisor.**

## Graduate Mentoring Seminars, 5:15-6:15pm @ Math 250

During the fall, semester topics in this seminar will cover a range of skills that professional mathematicians will need to master.  For the spring semester, professors in the department will give introductory talks on their area of research.  This seminar is mandatory for all first year graduate students, so please make this time slot available.

The schedule will be circulated soon.

## TA work

Since learning to teach mathematics is an integral part of your doctoral training, it is the policy of the dept. that all Ph.D. students be given a TAship as soon as possible.

-	You will receive your TA assignments the week before classes begin, and you should contact the instructors immediately upon receiving your assignments.  Recitations start in the first week of classes.
- More will come later in this orientation session.

##	Mathematical life

-	Department colloquium
-	Regular weekly seminars: Algebra, Analysis, Applied, and Geometry/Topology.
-	Myhill lectures, usually in Spring.
-	Regional graduate workshops.  (More will be covered in Tuesday Mentoring seminar.)
-	Funding. I will present in a graduate mentoring seminar.
-	Look at the AMS publication “A mathematician’s survival guide”.

## SPEAK test

All international PhD students have to pass a SPEAK test (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) to be able to teach. If you are RA (research assistantship, i.e., supported by a professor's reesarch grant money), you may finish PhD without teaching at all, but the UB policy dictates that you nevertheless have to pass the SPEAK test. Details are [here](https://www.buffalo.edu/english-language-institute/graduate/speak-test.html#title_122627731). Note that this webpage contains a practice test as well.

So, international PhD students should do the following right away:

- Book a SPEAK test with them. How to book it? See the instructions on their webpage (URL given above).
  - **Unless you register the SPEAK test in August (regardless of whether youp ass the test or not), you cannot register courses.**
- If you are from an English speaking country, contact them (their contact address should be available on their website) if you are exempt or not.
- If you pass it, you are done!
- If you don't, you need to retake it. The department will provide training for you to pass the exam within two years.


##	Miscellaneous

-	International students - change of address, I-20.
-	Jury duty
-	Office and mailbox keys can be obtained from main office.
-	Health insurance orientation
-	Your UB student ID card is your swipe card into the building.
-	Graduate copier, room 236. 


- Don’t forget the Welcoming Party:  eat pizza and wings, and have your picture taken for the Department’s Bulletin Board.
