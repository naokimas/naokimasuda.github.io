# New Graduate Student Orientation (Naoki's part) &ndash; Fall 2023

I have only 15 mins, so only key things you should know right now. I will present all others in my talk in Graduate Mentoring Seminar next week.

## TA/grader duties

This is for PhD students only.

- The TA training was on August 25th and 26th. So the new TAs already know about general duties.
- Grader training during Week 1.
- Handled by Dr. Tara Hudson. Contact her for any questions.

## Graduate Mentoring Seminars, Tuesdays 4-5pm @ Math 250

- This is 0-credit seminars, but this is mandatory for all the first-yera graduate students.
- Semester topics will cover a range of skills that professional mathematicians will need to master. Also, professors in the department - The schedule will be circulated soon.
  - First talk by me next week on the structure of the graduate programs.
  - No seminars in some weeks (you will see it in the schedule that will be distributed).

## First-year courses

- They are already starting!
- PhD and MA: You need to choose Pure or Applied Track and take the corresponding mandatory courses.
- MS: Read carefully the requirement and plan it ahead.
- More on this next week.

# Structure of graduate programs

##	First-year courses for PhD and MA students

Read your program's webpage under the "Graduate" tab on [the department's website](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math.html).

The first year courses are structured as a cohort sequence. You must be enrolled in either Pure or Applied track.

### Fall semester offering:

#### Pure track
-	Analysis--measure theory (MTH 534)
-	Algebra--groups and rings (MTH 519)
-	Geometry/Topology--point set topology (MTH 527)

####	Applied track
-	Numerical analysis I (MTH 537)
-	Methods of applied mathematics I (MTH 539)
-	Either of the three mandatory courses in the Pure track

### Spring semester offering:

#### Pure track
-	Analysis--complex analysis (MTH 625)
-	Algebra--module and galois theory (MTH 520)
-	Geometry/Topology--homotopy theory (MTH 528)

####	Applied track
-	Numerical analysis II (MTH 538)
-	Methods of applied mathematics II (MTH 540)
-	Either of the three mandatory courses in the Pure track or Applied Complex Analysis (new)

- If you are MA student or unsupported PhD student, you must register for a fourth course.
- There is an evaluation exam (often called qualifying exam) associated with each of the above courses. Evaluation exams are given during finals week. How it is given depends on the course, and the course instructor will let you know.
  - Many instructors of those courses us the final exam as the evaluation exam.
- PhD students must pass 4 out of 6 evaluation exams. MA students must pass 3 out of 6.
- Taking graduate classes as a cohort is meant to encourage studying mathematics in groups. So, create and get into study groups! (Also recommended for MS students)

##	First-year courses for MS students

- There is nothing named first-year courses.
- Plan NOW how many semesters you want to spend to graduate and which mandatory/elective courses you plan to take.
- Some courses do not occur every year/semester.
  - If you go to [the courses website](https://www.buffalo.edu/cas/math/courses.html), you can see all the Fall and Spring courses.
  - Popular courses fill quickly. Act quickly once the registration is open.
- A research project (3 credits) is mandatory in the third semester (if you plan to graduate in three semesters). You should contact preferred professor as advisor sometime between the second and third semester. Or I will talk to you to discuss this.

## Second and later years of the PhD course &ndash; Not many people have told this to you

### Credit count

- 72 credits to graduate, but this won't usually be an issue.
- You need to take an oral examination to advance to candidacy (Let's call it "oral exam").
  - Before you pass "oral exam", you need to take 9 credits per semester if you are TA and 12 credits per semester if you are not TA.
  - After you pass "oral exam", you only need to take 1 credit per semester.

### Start research

- At any point, you can look for research advisor (a.k.a. thesis advisor, or supervisor. Let's simply call it "advisor").
  - You approach preferred professor anytime to ask.
  - Some professors may say yes, some may say no, for various reasons.
  - Some professors prefer to start from the Reading course rather than to immediately agree with your advisor.
- Can take the Research course or Reading course for a variable number of credits.
  - An approval by the advisor (or the professor who has agreed to do a Reading course with you) is needed.
  - Paperwork is needed for registering to the Research/Reading course. Ask Jenny Russell.
- You may be hired as RA (research assistant) instead of TA.
  - It depends on the professor. Don't ask me.
  - You can come back to TA if the RA period has finished. The department monitors all such information, so no worries.

## Mentor

- Each new PhD student is assigned a mentor unless you already have an advisor.
- Mentor's roles:
  - Advise the mentee on the course choice.
  - Help the mentee to find research advisor.
  - Possibly pass to the mentee information on relevant seminar talks etc.
  - Not required to meet the mentee on a regular basis. It is up to the mentor.
  - The mentor system is only two years old. So, for now, let the mentor serve only the first year. Then, I will have a town meeting or similar to ask students whether the mentor has been useful. If yes and they want to continue to have the mentor, then I will ask the mentor to continue serving till they find research advisor.
- The selection of the mentor is based on the research area you expressed in your graduate school application (recommendation by each area committee's chair), but, importantly, it does not mean that you need to follow that path. If one wants to switch from algebra to topology, for example, it is totally fine. 
- Likewise, importantly, the mentor and advisor are totally independent things. Mentor does not imply advisor.


## TA work

Since learning to teach mathematics is an integral part of your doctoral training, it is the policy of the dept. that all Ph.D. students be given a TAship as soon as possible.

- Exception: RA. But, as far as I know, we have not had prior examples of 5-year RAs.
-	You will receive your TA assignments the week before classes begin, and you should contact the instructors immediately upon receiving your assignments. Recitations start in the first week of classes.
  -	Contact Associate Chair (not me) for teaching duties.
  -	Tara Hudson and others lead TA training.

## SPEAK test

All international PhD students have to pass a SPEAK test (Speaking Proficiency English Assessment Kit) to be able to teach. If you are RA (research assistantship, i.e., supported by a professor's reesarch grant money), you may finish PhD without teaching at all, but the UB policy dictates that you nevertheless have to pass the SPEAK test. Details are [here](https://www.buffalo.edu/english-language-institute/graduate/speak-test.html#title_122627731). Note that this webpage contains a practice test as well.

So, international PhD students should do the following right away:

- Book a SPEAK test with them. How to book it? See the instructions on their webpage (URL given above).
  - **Unless you register the SPEAK test in August (regardless of whether youp ass the test or not), you cannot register courses.**
- If you are from an English speaking country, contact them (their contact address should be available on their website) if you are exempt or not.
- If you pass it, you are done!
- If you don't, you need to retake it. The department will provide training for you to pass the exam within two years.


##	Mathematical life

-	Department colloquium
-	Regular weekly seminars: Algebra, Analysis, Applied, and Geometry/Topology.
-	Myhill lectures for three days.
-	Regional graduate workshops.
-	Funding.
-	Look at the AMS publication “A mathematician’s survival guide”.
-	Mingle. Connect. Explore. The graduate program is not just course taking.

##	Miscellaneous

-	International students - change of address, I-20.
-	Jury duty
-	Office and mailbox keys can be obtained from main office.
-	Health insurance orientation
-	Your UB student ID card is your swipe card into the building.
-	Graduate copier, room 236. 
-	[SUBgroups](https://gradsubgroups.org/) (online peer groups for first-year math graduate students), if you are interested. FYI.


- Don’t forget the Welcoming Party:  eat pizza and wings, and have your picture taken for the Department’s Bulletin Board.
